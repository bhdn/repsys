Description
===========

This branch is intended to allow repsys working with update/etc URLs
without having to use absolute URLs.

Ideas
======

Using relative paths:

  $ repsys co 2008.1/mutt

Using command line options to define which branch we are working:

  $ repsys co -b 2008.1 mutt

Anything else?

Problems
=========

- Branches must have their own misc/ or 00-Changelogs directory (actually
  this is not needed at all, as misc/ changelogs are not meant to be
  changed, so they will always be 'valid' in whatever branch it is used)
