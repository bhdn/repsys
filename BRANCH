Support package submit groups
=============================

It has been complained that repsys didn't have any way to submit more than
one package at once. Now repsys allows it and another interesting may be
useful: submitting package groups.

Fedora has something like "package groups", when a given package group is
requested to be rebuilt. It should ease a little the process of submitting
packages.

Brainstorm usage:

  repsys submit -t 2008.0 kde-packages

  repsys submit all-dkms


Notes
=====

- No support for using the <distro>/<package> format. The -d command line
  option should be used.


TODO
====

- change submit to expand the list

- add a configuration groups called "submit-groups" and each line defines
  a groups with package names separated by space:

  [submit-groups]
  kde-games = kfoo kbar kbaz
  gnome-craplets = gfoo gbar gbaz
  python-twisted =  foo bar baz
