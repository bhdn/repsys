Description
===========

Support separate repositories for tarballs.

TODO
=====

- Rename SOURCES/sources to SOURCES/binrepo.lst; less ambiguity when
  discussing about package structure.

- Support no-tarballs-and-no-binrepo.lst repositories: (MUST)

  + Support checkout and getsrpm without binrepo.lst;

    * binrepo.enabled() returns true if binrepo is enabled in conf (DONE)

    * download from binrepo those files that are referred in the spec but
      are not found in the svn checkout/export (MUST)
    
  + Enforce binrepo.lst on markrelease;

  + Enforce binrepo.lst on submit.

- Support updates/:

  + Merge the work from branch V1_6_X.feature.support-update-urls  (TODO)

- Fix update to download new files right after updating the svn checkout
  (this way we don't have to run up again to bring new binaries)
