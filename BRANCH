Description
===========

This branch is intended to allow repsys working with update/etc URLs
without having to use absolute URLs.

Ideas
======

Using relative paths:

  $ repsys co 2008.1/mutt

Using command line options to define which branch we are working:

  $ repsys co -b 2008.1 mutt

Anything else?

Strategy
========

Drop default_parent.

Introduce a function package_url, which takes the relative path (as in the
first form suggested above) and optionally some parameter about the path,
like 'release', 'version', or 'branch' (updates/).

package_url would use this information to build the path. It must be the
single way to handle URLs in repsys.

In order to support mirrors, this function would use mirror.enabled to
check if the complete URL has support to mirrors, and then return the
already-transformed URL to the caller.

All commands should have an option (probably -o, which is already used by
co) to disable the use of mirrors.

The problem with releases/
--------------------------

Functions that can't receive the final URL (with current/) as pkgdirurl:

- mark_release

- put_srpm

- get_srpm

- create_package

Problems
========= 

- mirrors!

- Branches must have their own misc/ or 00-Changelogs directory (actually
  this is not needed at all, as misc/ changelogs are not meant to be
  changed, so they will always be 'valid' in whatever branch it is used)
