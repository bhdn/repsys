repsys is the tool used to manage RPM packages in a subversion repository.
It is used to create, tag releases, generate .src.rpm, generate changelog,
and request new package releases for build. It mostly acts as a interface
to svn(1) commands and small task scripts run that on the build system side
over ssh(1).

For more information, see repsys(8) and

The discussion on the development of repsys takes place on the
